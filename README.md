Welcome to wekb2. 

wekb2 is a clone of wekb. The difference is that the wekb2 has been completely cleaned up and is developed in grails 5.

Developed by the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum NRW (hbz) in Cologne, the we:kb (what ever knowledge base) is an open Knowledge Base which serves as a central system in which providers' "sales units" can be made visible and curated in order to reflect these sales units' most actual state. While individual academic institutions and consortial teams alike may use the we:kb for the purpose of a cooperative curation of a provider's sales units/packages, this curation is ideally carried out directly by the respective provider. By giving the providers themselves the opportunity to curate their own packages in the we:kb, automated processes can ideally be set up in order to guarantee that the data within the packages is as up-to-date as possible. Aside from providing their packages with a corresponding title level, providers are also welcome to give valuable information on their own Organisation as well as their Platform(s), e.g. provide information on how to reach their Technical Support, how usage statistics are delivered or which Authentication methods are being supported. By using the we:kb as a central way to make all data concerning packages, providers and platforms more transparent, valuable information is being provided for the whole acquisition landscape in the German-speaking regions.
